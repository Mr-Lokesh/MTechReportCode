The codes are based on the classical laminated theory used to predict the mechanical properties in the unidirectional composites. Python programming language along with the some data analysis libraries like numpy and pandas are used to develop these codes.

These codes are tested for Ansys results and the predicted results are 90% accurate. The codes are also validate for the tensile modulus values experimently and we get an accuracy of around 80-85%. The samples are made by vacuum assisted microwave curing with 1:1 ratio of unidirectional carbon fiber and epoxy matrix. The 6 layered samples were tested for various orientation angle sequences for standard tensile tests on Universal Testing Machine.

Future Scope:  Researchers can fabricate different orientation sequence samples in different weight percentages and by using different materials and can validate the flexural and shear modulus values of codes through their experimental values.
